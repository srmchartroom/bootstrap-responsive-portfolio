# bootstrap-responsive-portfolio

## Description

### GOAL: 
* Create a Bootstrap-dominant-styled portfolio microsite with as few custom styles as possible, to fully leverage and demonstrate the power of the Bootstrap CSS framework.
* The portfolio microsite files include:
  - License (MIT license, feel free to use without constraint.)
  - README.md (You're reading it.)
  - About Page (index.html)
  - Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
  - Contact page (contact.html)
  - Assets folder:
    - *images*/ - Images displayed/used on the About page (index.html) and the Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
    - *styles*/ - Three very small/limited custom stylesheets: 
      - 1: body.css handling *only* the background gradient on the page. 
      - 2: footer.css handling *only* styling of the :active and :hover pseudoclasses of the footer social icons.
      - 3: portfolio.css handling *only* the position styling of the project title and the same couple of minor pseudoclass additions as on the footer. 

#### NOTE: A form has been styled and added to the contact.html page but is not yet coded to function on-submit.

### Key Design Elements/Decisions for Portfolio Microsite:
* Site is fully responsive.  There are no custom @media styles in order to demonstrate the power of bootstraps flexible grid and out-of-the-box mobile responsiveness.
* Site is dominantly styled with Bootstrap 4.5.0 classes. With the exception of just a handleful of style addition tweaks, nearly all of the styles are handled by Bootstrap's built-in classes.
* Additional classes are deliberately minimized to maintain nearly all styling via Bootstrap's CSS framework. There are literally only a handful (~7 tiny style tweaks, mostly to handle roll over effects no overtly classed out as navbar nav items in bootstrap). 
* Content scales to full viewer width at small and extra-small screens (e.g. mobile) and reflects main content window (~2/3 width) on largest screens.
* Portfolio projects are just dummmy projects and link to href="#" for now.  These may be filled in later with actual deployed applications.
* Bio is actual repository owner bio (so feel free to read and I welcome connection on linkedIn, StackOverflow, Twitter, GitHub, etc.).
