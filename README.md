# bootstrap-responsive-portfolio

## Description

### Task: 
* Create a Bootstrap-dominant-styled portfolio microsite.
* The portfolio microsite includes:
- About page (index.html)
- Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
- Contact page (contact.html)

#### NOTE: A form has been styled and added to the contact.html page but is not yet coded to function on-submit.

### Key Design Elements/Decisions for Portfolio Microsite:
* Site is fully responsive
* Site is dominantly styled with Bootstrap 4.5.0 classes.
* Additional classes are deliberately minimized to maintain nearly all styling via Bootstrap's CSS framework.
* Content scales to full viewer width at small and extra-small screens (e.g. mobile) and reflects main contet window (~2/3 width) on largest screens.
